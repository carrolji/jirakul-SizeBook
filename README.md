Problem Description

Consider the situation of an avid shopper, who often buys clothes for family, relatives, and close friends (both online and in person). This activity is fraught with difficulties, but one basic issue is keeping track of each person's dimensions. What is needed is a simple, attractive, intuitive, mobile app to manage this data. Let us call this app: SizeBook.

This simple, basic app, is focused on the dimensions needed to help size apparel worn on the main body (e.g., tops, bottoms, dresses, etc.) and not accessories (e.g., hats, shoes).

Also, set aside the broader matter of mapping dimensions to properly fitting clothing sizes (which can vary across clothing brands, geographic regions, and sizing categories).

Specifically, each person has a record with the following fields:

> name (textual)
*date (when the dimensions were reasonably valid, in yyyy-mm-dd format)
*neck (circumference in inches, numeric)
*bust (circumference in inches, numeric)
*chest (circumference in inches, numeric)
*waist (circumference in inches, numeric)
*hip (circumference in inches, numeric)
*inseam (length in inches, numeric)
*comment (textual)
